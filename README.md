# RGB sensor gui

My first JS based GUI to show the color decomposition of a photoresistance based sensor. Showing a graph with the RGB decomposition of the tested object.
Including serial interaction with a microcontroller, and toast feedback to the user. Eventually aiming to pack it into a stand alone app.

*This app was built using electron and react, along with the chartjs pluging for plotting.*
